              I'm not really sure how to answer this as I have no really
              encountered being stuck on a simple problem. I can discuss what I
              do with more complex ones, but not really a simple problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would normally assess how straightforward the problem is before
              jumping in and try solving it. If I hit a snag, I would normally
              look something up on Google. If there are enough information to
              solve said problem then I go ahead and attempt it, if not then its
              time to call my best friend YouTube. I personally find learning
              while watching much more effective than reading a whole book on
              how to tackle a task.

              There was a time when my parents found a puddle of water under the
              laundry sink and could not figure out how big or small this
              problem would be.
            </p>
            <p>
              I assessed the situation and was trying to figure out if it was a
              pipe leak or was it just something not being screwed on properly.
              We could call a plumber to take a look at it which would have cost
              a few hundred dollars or I could take a look and see if I can fix
              it, if not then there's always the option of ringing the plumber.
            </p>
            <p>
              First step was to clean and dry the area to determine if it is the
              water piping problem as it flows into the mixer or was the leak
              coming from the sink. After drying everything I placed a container
              under the area over night to see. because the process was so
              gradual we couldn't see the water dripping but we would know the
              next day how much water was leaking.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where I determined it was either the hot or cold water
              pipe that was flowing in to the mixer and not the sink itself.
              Using the tools I had (after turning the water off at the main
              source) I took apart the pipes, dried off everything and assembled
              them back together. Once again placing a container under the sink
              overnight to see if the problem has been fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Went to check on it the next morning and the container was
              completely dry. That was when I determined, it could have been one
              of the nuts that had not been tightened properly. Because if it
              was really a break in the pipe, we would have still seen water in
              the container, or I would need to do further investigation.
              Expensive pluming bill avoided.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned from this experience that it is ok to first try things
              yourself and to give it a go. Because at the end of the day, if I
              didn't attempt to fix it, we would have needed to ring a plumber,
              if I had tried to fix it and made a mess of it, we would have
              STILL needed to ring a plumber. Either way if the outcome is bad,
              a plumber would be needed, but if I tried it first, I could
              potentially save some money from attempting it myself.

                Pseudocode - somewhat confident, I do use this method from time
                to time, but I would be looking at doing this a bit more as it
                can help me process what I am trying to achieve.
              </li>
              <li>
                Trying something - feels like I am already doing this a lot, but
                overthinking can make this a pain as I can be trying things for
                4 hours with no result
              </li>
              <li>
                Console.logging - somewhat confident, I do use this from time to
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rubber ducky method - Have read about it but never personally
                tried it. Would be keen to try this when opportunity presents
                itself

              <li>Reading error messages - not really confident.</li>
              <li>
                Googling - fairly confident, but this takes me down

                Asking your peers for help - somewhat confident, feels like I'm

                Improving your process with reflection - somewhat confident,

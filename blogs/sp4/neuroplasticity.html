          Neuroplasticity
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            In basic, this is talking about how our brain can change and does
            change throughout our lives, and that the brain is not hard wired
            and fixed. Our brain is adaptable, like plastic, hence the term
            "Neuroplasticity".
          </p>

          <p>
            Our brain is like a central hub. Everything we do, experience etc is
            utilizing different parts of our brain. The more we do a certain
            task or build a certain pattern, the more it strengthens that
            particular pathway of the part of the brain that is used. This also
            means that we can break old habits and create new ones by
            consistently gearing our brain towards new thoughts or new ways of
            doing things.
          </p>

            There are many different materials out there for Neuroplasticity. I
            found this video on YouTube quite helpful.
          </p>

            Looking back I also found this Docuseries quite helpful in
            explaining certain things about "The Mind". But this is only on
            Netflix.

          Growth Mindset
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Growth mindset overlaps with neuroplasticity. A growth mindset is
            understanding that intelligence can be obtain. Putting in the right
            effort in learning, will help a person get to the goal they are
            trying to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading a growth mindset
            <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">article</a>, it was
            also mentioned that if effort was praised, it leads to a better
            outcome, where students are inclined to try harder to achieve a
            better grade. It also helps build resilience to bounce back after
            failure.

          <p>
            I will endeavour to incorporate what I have learned here not just
            into my learning plan but also for my own personal development. I
            have noticed tendencies in me to be self critical, and constantly
            comparing myself to others who are better than me.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one hand there is awareness that if I compare myself to others,
            this helps give me a guide to see where my weaknesses are and where
            improvements can be made. On the other hand, this can also be quite
            damaging. I am still in the process of exploring how to strike a
            balance of a healthy comparison where I view it as an opportunity to
            improve but at the same time not beat myself up and to allow myself
            time to grow.

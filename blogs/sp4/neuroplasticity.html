              In basic, this is talking about how our brain can change and does
              change throughout our lives, and that the brain is not hard wired
              and fixed. Our brain is adaptable, like plastic, hence the term
              "Neuroplasticity".
            </p>
            <p>
              Our brain is like a central hub. Everything we do, experience etc
              is utilizing different parts of our brain. The more we do a
              certain task or build a certain pattern, the more it strengthens
              that particular pathway of the part of the brain that is used.
              This also means that we can break old habits and create new ones
              by consistently gearing our brain towards new thoughts or new ways
              of doing things.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many different materials out there for Neuroplasticity.
              I found this video on YouTube quite helpful.

              Looking back I also found this Docuseries quite helpful in
              explaining certain things about "The Mind". But this is only on
              Netflix.

              Growth mindset overlaps with neuroplasticity. A growth mindset is
              understanding that intelligence can be obtain. Putting in the
              right effort in learning, will help a person get to the goal they
              are trying to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading a growth mindset
              <a class="internal-a" href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/"
                >article</a
              >, it was also mentioned that if effort was praised, it leads to a
              better outcome, where students are inclined to try harder to
              achieve a better grade. It also helps build resilience to bounce
              back after failure.

              I will endeavour to incorporate what I have learned here not just
              into my learning plan but also for my own personal development. I
              have noticed tendencies in me to be self critical, and constantly
              comparing myself to others who are better than me.
            </p>
            <p>
              On one hand there is awareness that if I compare myself to others,
              this helps give me a guide to see where my weaknesses are and
              where improvements can be made. On the other hand, this can also
              be quite damaging. I am still in the process of exploring how to
              strike a balance of a healthy comparison where I view it as an
              opportunity to improve but at the same time not beat myself up and
              to allow myself time to grow.

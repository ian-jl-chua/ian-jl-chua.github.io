              <!-- USE HUMAN ANATOMY -->
              So the whole things is somewhat like the human anatomy. HTML is
              like the skeleton, it holds the basic frame work and certain
              defining features. CSS is like the skin, hair, eyes, colour and
              tones etc. JavaScript is one of may activities you can use to
              interact with the human body. Like exercise for example.

            Explain control flow and loops using an example process from
            everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'

          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>
              By default JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom, line by
              line. This can be changed however with control flow. Control flow
              allows the programme to make decision about what code is executed,
              and when.
            </p>
            <p>
              So it is like doing exercises, there are conditions. You can do
              different exercises to target different muscle groups in your
              body. These can be represented in the form of IF statements. Like
              if your legs are still not sore enough, do a few more squats.
              Having this done over and over again is like a loop, so keep doing
              squats until your legs are sore.
            </p>
            <p>
              So together, the loop and conditionals are collectively known as
              control flow.

            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it.

                >The DOM is a programing interface for web documents.</a
              >It is a representation of a page so that programs can change the
              structure, style and content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOM is a structure that web browsers use to make sense of the
              different things going on in the HTML, CSS and JS documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside the DOM everything are nodes. The elements, the attributes,
              comments, text, these are all nodes inside the DOM. So comparing
              this to the human anatomy, it is like studying the human anatomy
              and how each part of the body functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you know the DOM, then you can use JS to change parts of the
              human structure, this is like interacting with it. So lets say you
              want to strengthen grip strength, you would need to grip related
              exercises by understanding the hands and forearm in the DOM.

            Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects.
          </h2>
          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>
              Objects are "obvious" as explained in one of the YouTube videos.
              Arrays are a list of objects (which might not be so obvious), it
              is a special type of object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objects uses curly brackets "{}" and to describe on object, we use
              key and values. Like if you are using an exercise equipment. You
              can describe the equipment. So description are the "keys" for the
              object and the adjectives are "values"
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <figure class="img-container">
              <img
                class="blog-img"
                alt="code example 1"
                src="../../assets/obj.png"
                width="600"
                height="400"
              />
              <figcaption>Example Code</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              An array is like a list and it uses "[]". So it can be compared to
              the list of work outs you are doing, or like a list of body parts
              you want to focus on during your exercise. Here there are no keys
              or values, they are elements, and each element has a number assign
              to it and it starts from [0]. [0] is the first element [1] is the
              second and so on. Each time and array is updated (eg if an element
              is removed) the array would align itself accordingly
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <figure class="img-container">
              <img
                class="blog-img"

              <figcaption>Example Code</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>so push is [0] pull is [1] and legs is [2]</p>

            Explain what functions are and why they are helpful

          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>
              A function is a set of statement that performs a task or
              calculates something. So using the exercising example:
            </p>
            <figure class="img-container">
              <img
                class="blog-img"
                alt="code example 3"
                src="../../assets/func.png"
                width="600"
                height="400"
              />
              <figcaption>Example Code</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This would tell the person if they are exhausted. They would need
              to rest, if not then they would need to keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arguments can then be sent to a function to get the function to
              carry out that task. So in this case, the argument would be
              "exhausted"

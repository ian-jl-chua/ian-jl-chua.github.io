              "Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to understand
              and manage your own emotions, as well as recognize and influence
              the emotions of those around you. The term was first coined in
              1990 by researchers John Mayer and Peter Salovey, but was later
              popularized by psychologist Daniel Goleman."

              This article talks about 4 components. Self-awareness,
              Self-management, Social awareness, and Relationship management.
              Although the wider internet seems to show 5 component, with
              Empathy and Motivation most likely grouped under the same umbrella
              as "Relationship management"

            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am hoping to apply the coding as well as human skills not only in
            work, but in the various aspect of my life as well, especially
            looking more into neuroplasticity.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the long term goal, it is still much the same as what I
            mentioned back in Sprint 2. I am very much interested how tech would
            shape the financial sector. Tech has been advancing exponentially
            even in just the past few years and this is changing the face of
            finance and how people do their banking.
          </p>
          <p>
            But of course, coding is still very new to me, so I will see where
            life takes me.

            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Well reflecting back... I think its safe to say, what I wrote in
            Sprint 2 was accurate. My strength can become my weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I get so focused and caught up in the attention to detail, I
            am mindful and a bit more aware of my tendency to go too deep down
            the rabbit hole. Sometimes it is a matter of getting a feel of what
            I need to know, instead of what I want to know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going into bootcamp does make me nervous. But I am still willing to
            stays mindful and learn as much as I can and see if I can catch
            myself before going down rabbit holes.

          <p>
            Public speaking is definitely not my strong suit. Although I am
            comfortable working in small groups, I do feel anxious when I speak
            in public. I'm just more nervous for presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            However I do feel that if I have at least a basic understanding of
            what I am talking about, this does help ease some of the anxiety I
            have.

          <p>
            I don't really have much expectations from the Bootcamp team, as per
            my previous blog reflection.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would just hope to be shown a bit more patience as I am dyslexic
            and learning new things is quite challenging for me, especially when
            its just not making sense so it doesn't click for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do hope that no lecturers take any offense if I seek others out
            for clarification. It is not that I don't trust them, I just like to
            see things from different points of view and learning from different
            sources to see what helps me understand best.

          <p>
            I haven't really thought much about a long term goal, as the
            immediate focus of mine is to complete the course and to get a job
            so I can put the learning into real world practice.

            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of my greatest known strengths, is my attention to detail. But
            turns out that it can be my limitation as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can be so focused on one thing, or getting one thing done
            right/properly to the highest standard, that I can miss the "Big
            Picture". So on one hand, if I know something, I know it really well
            and in detail. On the other hand, I spent way too much time getting
            lost in the rabbit hole.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remembered something that was mentioned from one of the spiritual
            teachers, something along the lines of,"You don't need to calculate
            the vibration of the particles in the strings, or explain how that
            sound travels to the ear of the listener, to play the guitar. What
            you need to know is whether you are in tune, or out of tune. If you
            are out of tune, just adjust your strings so that you are back in
            tune."
          </p>
          <p>
            I am still working out the balance so that I know what is needed and
            helpful, but not going down the rabbit hole and spending so much
            time getting caught up in the details.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The ability to communicate and work along side others who might not
            share the same values and/or goals as me.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all want to succeed in life, but success means different things
            to different people. What I find important to succeed, may not be
            what someone else finds important.

          <p>
            After taking the 16 personalities test, I am more aware that
            sometimes I can be "socially clueless" and other times dismissive of
            emotions. Knowing how to manage potential conflict or differences,
            would greatly improve an environment where we need to co-exist.

            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:

          <h3>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively

            you.

          <p>Here are a few things I endeavour to do to manage my workload:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Making sure to take my breaks - sometimes I get so caught up in a
              problem or a task that I neglect getting up from my seat to take a
              break.
            </li>
            <li>
              Daily meditation - making sure I take some time out of my day to
              mediate, even if it means spending 5 minutes to give myself the
              time for clarity
            </li>
            <li>
              Empathize with others - whilst this is not an excuse for being
              hostile, understanding that sometimes when people are hostile or
              angry, it might be because of something happening in their
              personal lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember to seek help - sometimes I can get stuck on something for
              ages and I can get too nervous or feel too stupid to ask for help
            </li>
            <li>
              Remember not to panic - if things build up and get overwhelming,
              to remember to take a breather and re-assess the situation.
              Sometimes taking time away from the screen can help rest my mood.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep track of the time so that I don't get stuck on something for
              too long, doing this by keeping an eye on the time requirement for
              time required in the time box.
            </li>
            <li>
              If I am not able to meet a dead line to keep my tutor in the loop.
              Also to set a time frame on when this can be achieved.
            </li>
            <li>
              If dead lines are not met consistently to set a plan of attack on
              what to do to prioritize what needs to be done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilizing the Discord channel to seek assistance from my tutors.

            A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I would say "like to receive" as oppose to "expect". From past
            experience, expectations lead to disappointment.

          <p>
            I would like the Facilitation team to have a bit of patience with
            me. Because being dyslexic, certain things take me longer to
            understand, and sometimes I need to see a few methods from a few
            different source to fully understand certain things.

            The only block-out day is mainly Saturday. This is the day I do part

            What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The general rule would be to use class to style elements in a HTML
            document where ID is targeting a specific element of that HTML
            document. If both class and ID are used in an element, the ID rule
            is applied if there are overlap in instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example if there is a 'font-weight: bold' in the class and a
            'font-weight: lighter' in the ID
          </p>

          <img class="imageclass" src="../../assets/image-class-id1.png" />
          <br />

          <p>and both of these are applied to an element.</p>
          <img class="imageclass" src="../../assets/image-class-id2.png" />

          <p>The 'font-weight: lighter' would be applied to the element.</p>

          <p>
            The way to look can be like a school. The "Class" are like class
            rooms in a school, and the "ID" are like the students. You can have
            many "Class"rooms but individual student "ID"s unique to each
            student.
          </p>

          <p>NOTE: Class and ID selectors are case sensitive</p>

          <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Class</h2>
          <p>
            Is not unique and can be used to style <span>multiple</span> element
            on the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            An element can also have more than one class selector. Here we can
            see two class selectors (one and two) in one element
          </p>

        <article>
          <h2 class="blog-subtitle">ID</h2>
          <p>
            IS unique and can only be used to style <span>one</span> element on
            the document.
          </p>
          <p>Useful in conjunction with JavaScript</p>
          <p>
            Can only appear ONCE on a page, and you cannot combine 2 ID selector
            together. You can only do this with Class selectors
          </p>
          <p>
            Are good for creating links to different sections on a same webpage

            What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
          </h2>
          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>
              The general rule would be to use class to style elements in a HTML
              document where ID is targeting a specific element of that HTML
              document. If both class and ID are used in an element, the ID rule
              is applied if there are overlap in instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example if there is a 'font-weight: bold' in the class and a
              'font-weight: lighter' in the ID
            </p>
          </div>
          <figure class="img-container">
            <img

          </figure>
          <br />
          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>and both of these are applied to an element.</p>
          </div>
          <figure class="img-container">
            <img
              class="blog-img"
              alt="picture of code example 2"
              src="../../assets/image-class-id2.png"

              The way to look can be like a school. The "Class" are like class
              rooms in a school, and the "ID" are like the students. You can
              have many "Class"rooms but individual student "ID"s unique to each
              student.
            </p>
            <p>NOTE: Class and ID selectors are case sensitive</p>

            <p>
              Is not unique and can be used to style
              <span>multiple</span> element on the document.
            </p>
            <p>
              An element can also have more than one class selector. Here we can
              see two class selectors (one and two) in one element

            <p>Useful in conjunction with JavaScript</p>
            <p>
              Can only appear ONCE on a page, and you cannot combine 2 ID
              selector together. You can only do this with Class selectors

              Are good for creating links to different sections on a same

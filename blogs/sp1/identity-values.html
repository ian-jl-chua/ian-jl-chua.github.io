            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

              I have been working in the filed of finance for about 5 years. I
              can't think of a specific situation because I feel that this needs
              to happen with all situations, with every customer. An example I
              can use is to deal with loan applications in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst I am aware that every company needs to make money, I feel
              that this can be done ethically too. That means if a loan
              application is unlikely going to work, I won't tweak the
              application just to make it work, at the expense of it being
              detrimental to the customer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is because assessing a loan application is very much an area
              open for interpretation, what someone else thinks can be omitted
              in an application, might not be something I want to omit when I
              assess the loan. If a customer's gambling habit is going to affect
              their loan repayment, this needs to be included into the expense
              to paint a clearer picture on the customer’s position. 
            </p>
            <p>
              And this may lead to the loan application being decline, the
              customer being upset about the outcome, and the company losing a
              sale. But by not approving this application, I know that I didn’t
              put the customer in a worse off financial position, and if the
              declined was explained properly to the customer, they will know
              what changes are needed to be made in order for us to consider
              their future application. Instead of a "No" it becomes a "Not now,
              but here's how."

            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </h2>
          <div class="blog-answer">
            <p>
              Growing up in a Buddhist background, I am taught at a young age to
              fear karma, in other words "What goes around, comes around." and
              "Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you." But as I go
              through the various stages of adulthood, I also realize that just
              because I treat others well, doesn't mean that others would treat
              me well.
            </p>
            <p>
              So when Karma is incorporated with rebirth, it becomes a situation
              where "What goes around, comes around, but you may not always be
              able to experience the fruits of your good deed in this lifetime
              or you may have to go through certain difficulties because of what
              you have done in past lifetimes."
            </p>
            <p>
              There are times that life is hard and I have to remind myself to
              persevere with good values, even if it means I am the short term
              loser, because in the long term (maybe not this life) things would
              work out better. And this ends up changing the outlook I have in
              terms of values and identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, my approach in life has also changed. I aim to
              surround myself with people who share the same (if not similar)
              values to me, and distance myself from those who don't. But we
              can't always surround ourselves with people we like and distant
              ourselves from those who don't, because life is more complex than
              that. One of the things I hope to learn (in this journey of life),
              is how to co-exist with people who don't share my values. Because
              saying something is your value, and actually practicing and living
              the value, are 2 different things.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some values that are important to me:</p>
            <ul class="blog-points">
              <li>
                Sincerity - (I'm ok if people don't like me, I'm just not ok
                with people pretending to like me)
              </li>
              <li>Accountability - (Do what you say, and say what you do)</li>
              <li>
                Honesty and Integrity - (Truthfulness is important. But right
                action, at the right time, at the right place, those are equally
                important.)
              </li>

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your

              Fot this I have taken the 16 Personalities assessment and found
              out that I'm an Architect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of all the strengths mentioned for an Architect. One stood out in
              particular for me. "Determined – This personality type is known
              for being ambitious and goal-oriented. Architects won’t rest until
              they’ve achieved their own definition of success – which usually
              entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them."
            </p>
            <p>
              The only thing about this, is that some things take time. And
              although I am driven to achieve a lot in a small space of time, I
              am also aware that sometimes there can be external factors that
              hold me back.
            </p>
            <p>
              But never the less, the determination piece will still be there,
              to achieve my goals.

            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career

              I would like to say, my main limitation is being dyslexic. And a
              minor one being time management, because there are times when I
              manage well and there are times when I don't.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think both of those will go hand in hand to brew the perfect
              storm. Under normal circumstances I would factor a set amount of
              time into doing a task, but what I can't factor in, is the time it
              takes for me to first understand how long it would take if I do
              get stuck.
            </p>
            <p>So 2 examples will be, meal prep and fixing the tap.</p>
            <p>
              With meal preparation it is easy, I have done this task for years
              and it has become a part of me, so time management isn't an issue
              because I know exactly how long to allocate for and what needs to
              be done.
            </p>
            <p>
              With fixing a tap. I would allocate a set time to do the task, but
              I can't take into account how long it would take me to figure out
              what the problem is to begin with. And this could take me a few
              minutes or a few hours. And this affects my time management
              because I would over estimate and not get a task completed on
              time.

            <p>This is something I don't really have a clear example for.</p>
            <p>
              For most of my work life, I was not in a position where I needed
              to manage a team. I have the area that I need to look after and as
              long as I have taken care of my side of things, I try not to get
              involved with what others are doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              From past experience I have been in situations where it was a
              "Mind your own business" and "You're not the boss of me", so I
              tend to work in areas where I can work independently so that what
              others do, don't impact the outcome of my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like the most recent job. I am in a role where customers get
              booked in to see me for an appointment. This is quite independent
              in a sense that if I took too long with a customer, my colleagues
              are not impacted. If I spend a bit of extra time with the customer
              and I went to lunch late, it is up to me to juggle my lunch break
              so I can see my next customer on time. It is between me and my
              customers. This is different to my previous job in a retail
              environment where, if I'm' late to lunch, my colleague goes late
              to lunch, and it was a domino effect so the team can be impacted
              at large.
            </p>
            <p>
              But often at my various jobs, I would hear people say "Ask for
              forgiveness, not permission.". This is something interesting that
              I would apply when I am in a situation that requires me to do
              things that way.

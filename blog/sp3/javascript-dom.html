            <!-- USE HUMAN ANATOMY -->
            So the whole things is somewhat like a pop up book. HTML is the book
            and the basic layout of images and text and so on. CSS is the style
            of the text, colour, even changing a bit of the images. JavaScript
            is like the popping up of images in the book, and the little tabs
            you can pull to make the images move

        <li>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not
          those).
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            By default JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom, line by
            line. This can be changed however with control flow. Control flow
            allows the programme to make decision about what code is executed,
            and when.

          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
          CSS.

            <!-- USE HUMAN ANATOMY -->
            So the whole things is somewhat like the human anatomy. HTML is like
            the skeleton, it holds the basic frame work and certain defining
            features. CSS is like the skin, hair, eyes, colour and tones etc.
            JavaScript is one of may activities you can use to interact with the
            human body. Like exercise for example.
          </p>

          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not
          those).
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            By default JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom, line by
            line. This can be changed however with control flow. Control flow
            allows the programme to make decision about what code is executed,
            and when.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it is like doing exercises, there are conditions. You can do
            different exercises to target different muscle groups in your body.
            These can be represented in the form of IF statements. Like if your
            legs are still not sore enough, do a few more squats. Having this
            done over and over again is like a loop, so keep doing squats until
            your legs are sore.
          </p>
          <p>
            So together, the loop and conditionals are collectively known as
            control flow.

          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"
              >The DOM is a programing interface for web documents.</a
            >It is a representation of a page so that programs can change the
            structure, style and content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DOM is a structure that web browsers use to make sense of the
            different things going on in the HTML, CSS and JS documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the DOM everything are nodes. The elements, the attributes,
            comments, text, these are all nodes inside the DOM. So comparing
            this to the human anatomy, it is like studying the human anatomy and
            how each part of the body functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you know the DOM, then you can use JS to change parts of the
            human structure, this is like interacting with it.
          </p>

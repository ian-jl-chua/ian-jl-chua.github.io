        The 2 things I did learn about myself are how critical I am towards
        myself and also how reluctant I am to ask for help....
      </p>
      <p>
        I would end up beating myself up (mentally) and thinking about how much
        I suck, every time someone post a question on Discord, because seeing
        other peoples questions, made me realize how much I DON'T understand and
        how far others are ahead of me. When and if I do catch this pattern, I
        do remind myself that I need to be aware that I'm dyslexic and I learn
        things differently, furthermore I'm learning this for the first time, so
        it might take a while to "click".
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking for help is also a big thing, as I am quite reluctant to do
        this... Not sure if this is the fear of others viewing me as stupid, or
        just my stubbornness with the brute force approach, or maybe a bit of
        both. I also feel more comfortable asking for help from people I know
        well, as oppose to people whom I don't know.
      </p>

        I can see now that values, empathy, and self-awareness has a huge role,
        not just in learning and programming, but in life in general as well. I
        do feel that values are somewhat subjective, as this varies from
        individual to individual based on one's upbringing and their life
        experiences (like values I hold that are important to me, might not be
        what others see as important and vice versa) but empathy and
        self-awareness, I feel these are more universal and it plays a much more
        significant role. Especially when 2 people don't see eye to eye, empathy
        and self-awareness from both parties can help defuse any tension.

        I won't say there are any aspects about the core learning that are
        challenging (maybe the part forcing me to face my demons of self
        criticism). I think the challenging part is juggling to make sure that
        the core blogs are being written, whilst trying to find extra time to go
        over coding materials that I need more time on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I must admit I do feel that I should be spending more time
        practicing programming instead of spending the time on core. Because it
        is hard enough being new to programming and learning all new things
        being crammed into a short time-frame, it is even harder when I know at
        the back of my mind that I need to complete this whole other part, that
        has nothing to do with programming. So I do end up spending less time
        looking in to the core stuff because I feel that learning programing
        should be my primary focus for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        In saying all that, I can also see why a programming school would spend
        the time focusing on core learning in a web development course, because
        the human relations side of things are equally as important as learning
        how to code. No point being an expert coder who can't work well with
        anyone in any environment.

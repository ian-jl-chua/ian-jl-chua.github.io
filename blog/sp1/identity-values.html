          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            I have been working in the filed of finance for about 5 years. I
            can't think of a specific situation because I feel that this needs
            to happen with all situations, with every customer. An example I can
            use is to deal with loan applications in general.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whilst I am aware that every company needs to make money, I feel
            that this can be done ethically too. That means if a loan
            application is unlikely going to work, I won't tweak the application
            just to make it work, at the expense of it being detrimental to the
            customer.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is because assessing a loan application is very much an area
            open for interpretation, what someone else thinks can be omitted in
            an application, might not be something I want to omit when I assess
            the loan. If a customer's gambling habit is going to affect
            their loan repayment, this needs to be included into the expense to
            paint a clearer picture on the customer’s position. 
          </p>

          <p>
            And this may lead to the loan application being decline, the
            customer being upset about the outcome, and the company losing a
            sale. But by not approving this application, I know that I didn’t
            put the customer in a worse off financial position, and if the
            declined was explained properly to the customer, they will know what
            changes are needed to be made in order for us to consider their
            future application. Instead of a "No" it becomes a "Not now, but
            here's how."
          </p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            Growing up in a Buddhist background, I am taught at a young age to
            fear karma, in other words "What goes around, comes around." and "Do
            unto others, as you would have them do unto you." But as I go
            through the various stages of adulthood, I also realize that just
            because I treat others well, doesn't mean that others would treat me
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when Karma is incorporated with rebirth, it becomes a situation
            where "What goes around, comes around, but you may not always be
            able to experience the fruits of your good deed in this lifetime or
            you may have to go through certain difficulties because of what you
            have done in past lifetimes."
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times that life is hard and I have to remind myself to
            persevere with good values, even if it means I am the short term
            loser, because in the long term (maybe not this life) things would
            work out better. And this ends up changing the outlook I have in
            terms of values and identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, my approach in life has also changed. I aim to
            surround myself with people who share the same (if not similar)
            values to me, and distance myself from those who don't. But we can't
            always surround ourselves with people we like and distant ourselves
            from those who don't, because life is more complex than that. One of
            the things I hope to learn (in this journey of life), is how to
            co-exist with people who don't share my values. Because saying
            something is your value, and actually practicing and living the
            value, are 2 different things. Here are some values that are
            important to me:

          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p></p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.

          Neuroplasticity
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            In basic, this is talking about how our brain can change and does
            change throughout our lives, and that the brain is not hard wired
            and fixed. Our brain is adaptable, like plastic, hence the term
            "Neuroplasticity".
          </p>

          <p>
            Our brain is like a central hub. Everything we do, experience etc is
            utilizing different parts of our brain. The more we do a certain
            task or build a certain pattern, the more it strengthens that
            particular pathway of the part of the brain that is used. This also
            means that we can break old habits and create new ones by
            consistently gearing our brain towards new thoughts or new ways of
            doing things.

            There are many different materials out there for Neuroplasticity. I
            found this video on YouTube quite helpful.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Looking back I also found this Docuseries quite helpful in
            explaining certain things about "The Mind". But this is only on
            Netflix.

        <p>
          I'm not really sure how to answer this as I have no really encountered
          being stuck on a simple problem. I can discuss what I do with more
          complex ones, but not really a simple problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would normally assess how straightforward the problem is before
          jumping in and try solving it. If I hit a snag, I would normally look
          something up on Google. If there are enough information to solve said
          problem then I go ahead and attempt it, if not then its time to call
          my best friend YouTube. I personally find learning while watching much
          more effective than reading a whole book on how to tackle a task.

          What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            I haven't really thought much about a long term goal, as the
            immediate focus of mine is to complete the course and to get a job
            so I can put the learning into real world practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am interested in blockchain in the finance field, so hope to gain
            a bit more understanding on this as I progress with my knowledge on
            coding. Because I have an understanding in Traditional Finance
            (TradFi), I am interested to see how Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
            differs from that.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>As mentioned in Sprint 1 core section.</p>

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The ability to communicate and work along side others who don't
            share the same values and/or goals as me.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all want to succeed in life, but success means different things
            to different people. What I find important to succeed, may not be
            what someone else finds important.
          </p>
          <p>
            After taking the 16 personalities test, I am more aware that
            sometimes I can be Socially clueless and other times dismissive of
            emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing how to manage potential conflict or differences, would
            greatly improve an environment where we need to co-exist.

        <li>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
          This should include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
              productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
              industry/community representatives
            </li>
            <li>
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
              to you.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p></p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p></p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            I would say "like to receive" as oppose to "expect". From past
            experience, expectations lead to disappointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like the Facilitation team to have a bit of patience with
            me. Because being dyslexic, certain things take me longer to
            understand, and sometimes I need to see a few methods from a few
            different source to fully understand certain things.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The only block-out day is mainly Saturday. This is the day I do part
            of the bulk cooking for the week, and have a bit of social life (if
            any) with friends in the evening.

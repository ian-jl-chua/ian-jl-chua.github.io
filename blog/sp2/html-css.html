        What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The general rule would be to use class to style elements in a HTML
        document where ID is targeting a specific element of that HTML document.
        If both class and ID are used in an element, the ID rule is applied if
        there are overlap in instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example if there is a 'font-weight: bold' in the class and a
        'font-weight: lighter' in the ID
      </p>

      <img class="imageclass" src="../blog/image-class-id1.png" />
      <br />

      <p>and both of these are applied to an element.</p>
      <img class="imageclass" src="../blog/image-class-id2.png" />

      <p>The 'font-weight: lighter' would be applied to the element.</p>

      <p>
        The way to look can be like a school. The "Class" are like class rooms
        in a school, and the "ID" are like the students. You can have many
        "Class"rooms but individual student "ID"s unique to each student.
      </p>

      <p>NOTE: Class and ID selectors are case sensitive</p>

    <div class="para words">
      <h3><span>Class</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is not unique and can be used to style <span>multiple</span> element
          on the document.
        </li>
        <li>
          An element can also have more than one class selector. Here we can see
          two class selectors (one and two) in one element
        </li>
        <br />
        <img class="imageclass" src="../blog/class.png" />
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="para words">
      <h3><span>ID</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          IS unique and can only be used to style <span>one</span> element on
          the document.
        </li>
        <li>Useful in conjunction with JavaScript</li>
        <li>
          Can only appear ONCE on a page, and you cannot combine 2 ID selector
          together. You can only do this with Class selectors
        </li>
        <li>
          Are good for creating links to different sections on a same webpage
        </li>
      </ul>
